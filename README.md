# 159.356: Massey Capstone 2022 S2
## Active Shooter Workflow
### Overview
This is the 2022 Massey Capstone project for:
 - Bradley Grapes
 - Melissa Maillot
 - Isaac Achten
 - Jordan Russell

This project is sponsored by Professor Regan Potangaroa of the School of Built Environment at Massey University, and supervised by Athar Imtiaz, a lecturer in the School of Fundamental Sciences, also at Massey.

The goal of the project is to create and implement a workflow that allows a scanned environment to be dropped into a Unity or Unreal Engine project that can then be configured with reasonable ease to virtually train staff familiar with that environment in the fundamentals of active shooter training: Run --> Hide --> Fight.

Videos detailing the current state of the project are available for the [process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3zAbHYYlC0) and the setup [workflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITznF7UDTPc).
